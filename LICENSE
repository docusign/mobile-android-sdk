5.	TERM AND TERMINATION

5.1		Term.  The term of this EULA is defined by either a mutually executed agreement (setting forth the applicable term) under which You purchased the Software, or, in the absence of a mutually executed agreement between You and DocuSign, the duration of Your use of the Software (“Term”).  

5.2		Termination.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, DocuSign may (at its sole discretion) suspend or terminate this EULA if You fail to comply with any term of this EULA. 

5.3		Post-termination Obligations.  Upon termination of this EULA, You shall cease all use of the Software and Documentation and, if requested by DocuSign, confirm in writing to DocuSign that all copies of the Software have been destroyed or deleted from any and all computer libraries or storage devices in Your possession and/or control.  DocuSign’s rights and Your obligations under Sections 5.3 and 8 through 10 will survive the termination of this EULA.

6.	WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES

6.1		Limited Warranty.  DocuSign warrants that all Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation, for ninety (90) days from the Effective Date. This limited warranty does not cover problems that You cause, that arise when You fail to follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond DocuSign’s reasonable control. Any Upgrades and/or Updates that You may receive from DocuSign during that ninety (90) day period are also covered, but only for the remainder of that ninety (90) day period. Transferring the Software will not extend the limited warranty.

6.2		Correction of Program Errors.  Any non-conformity of the Software (a “Program Error”), if any, reported by You must be accompanied or followed by sufficient information to enable DocuSign to reproduce and verify the Program Error including, but not limited to, the input data that generated the Program Error.  Once DocuSign has received all such information, if DocuSign is able to reproduce and verify the Program Error, DocuSign shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a remedy. Remedies may include, without limitation, providing instructions for You to cure the Program Error, or delivering a software patch or update.  In no circumstances does DocuSign represent or warrant that any or all Program Errors can or will be remedied.

6.3		Mutual Warranties.  Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) this EULA has been duly executed and delivered and constitutes a valid and binding agreement enforceable against it in accordance with its terms; (b) no authorization or approval from any third party is required in connection with its execution, delivery, or performance of this EULA; and (c) the execution, delivery, and performance of this EULA does not violate the laws of any jurisdiction or the terms or conditions of any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is otherwise bound.

6.4		THIS SECTION 6, SETS FORTH YOUR SOLE REMEDY AND DOCUSIGN’S ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY DOCUSIGN WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION UNDER THIS EULA. Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, the above limitation may not apply to You.  In that event, such warranties are limited to the maximum extent permitted by, and to the minimum warranty period allowed by the mandatory applicable law.

7. 	BETA VERSION 

7.1	If You received a Beta Version, then this Section 7 applies.  To the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this EULA, this Section shall supersede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Beta Version, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.  

7.2	Risks Associated with Beta Version. WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR BETA VERSION SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, DOCUSIGN’S TOTAL, CUMULATIVE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS ($50 USD).  You acknowledge and agree that a Beta Version is not commercially released, and has not yet been tested like other commercially released software that You may use.  Therefore, it is likely that the Beta Version will contain errors, including errors that may cause the Software or Your systems to malfunction or cause a loss of data.  If You do not wish to accept the risk of errors, You must not install or use the Beta Version.  

7.3	No Technical Support. DocuSign is not obligated to correct errors, correct the effects of errors (e.g., fix Your computer or recover lost data), or provide any technical support related to use of the Beta Version.  

7.4	Beta Version Termination. Any license or right to use a Beta Version will terminate immediately after a new version (beta or other type) of Software is released by DocuSign.  Upon receipt of a later unreleased Beta Version or release by DocuSign of a publicly released commercial version of Software, You will return or destroy all earlier Beta Version(s) received from DocuSign and will abide by the terms of this EULA for any such later versions. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if You are located outside the United States of America, You agree that it will return or destroy all Beta Version(s) in Your possession within thirty (30) days of the completion of Your testing of the Software when such date is earlier than the date for DocuSign’s first commercial shipment of the publicly released (commercial) Software.

8.	YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

8.1		You agree to defend, hold harmless and indemnify DocuSign, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and suppliers, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to Your use of the Software, violation of this EULA or other actions connected with use of DocuSign Services, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, of every kind and nature.

Notices are deemed given upon receipt if delivered using DocuSign Services, two business days following the date of mailing, or one business day following delivery to a courier.

10.5	Mandatory Arbitration.  Except for claims arising under this EULA: (a) arising out of the indemnity obligations specified in Section 8; and (b) for injunctive relief, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to this EULA or the performance, enforcement, breach, termination, validity or interpretation thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this EULA to arbitrate, that cannot be resolved through good faith discussions between the parties within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), will be settled by binding arbitration conducted before one arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (”JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if applicable, or otherwise pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the “JAMS Rules”).  Either party may submit the matter to arbitration.  Such disputes will be resolved by the arbitrator as determined under the JAMS Rules. The arbitration shall be initiated and take place in San Francisco, California, United States, and You and DocuSign agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco, California in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Each party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration and will share equally the costs of the arbitration; provided, however, that the arbitrator may, in its discretion, award costs and fees to the prevailing party.  Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the award or over the applicable party or its assets. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND DOCUSIGN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations, or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in any state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

10.6	Governing Law.  This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules to the contrary. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California, for the purposes of adjudicating any dispute arising out of this EULA. To the extent permitted by law, choice of law rules, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act as enacted shall not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may at any time seek and obtain appropriate legal or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for claims regarding such party’s intellectual property rights. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this EULA.

10.7	Waiver.  The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this EULA does not waive any other breach.  The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this EULA will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this EULA.

10.8	Severability.  If any part of this EULA is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of this EULA will remain in full force and effect.  If any material limitation or restriction on the grant of any license DocuSign provides to You under this EULA is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the license will immediately terminate.

10.9	Entire Agreement. This EULA, which includes the language and paragraphs preceding Section 1, is the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the agreement between You and DocuSign.  This EULA supersedes, and the parties disclaim any reliance on, all previous oral and written communications (including any confidentiality agreements pertaining to the Software or Documentation under this EULA, representations, proposals, understandings, and negotiations with respect to the matter hereof and apply to the exclusion of any other terms that the You seek to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.
